            <p class="p1">Monal is more secure</a>
            <p class="p2">by Anu on MAR. 01, 2011 in <a href="http://monal.im/topics/why/"><span class="s1">WHY MONAL?</span></a></p>
            <p class="p3">Monal is more secure than other iOS instant messaging programs.  Since it is a direct client, it connects directly to the server you have entered without going through a middle man. The lack of a middle man is important for the following reasons.</p>
            <p class="p3"><b>Protect your password</b></p>
            <p class="p3">We all know that you should never give your work or personal IM username and password to any website that asks for it. This is even more important when you use the same username and password for email or corporate login systems. Similarly, this information  should never given  any random app that asks for it.</p>
            <p class="p3">Many iOS apps that support push messaging make a copy of login information and store it in a database on their own server.  These apps are never directly connected to the IM service but to a middle man.  The middle man keeps the  username and password of all users. If and when you stop using the IM client, the middle man will still have all of this information.</p>
            <p class="p3">This is an incredibly dangerous practice. The safety of a user’s personal information is entirely dependent on the security and trustworthiness of individuals who have access to these databases on a daily basis.</p>
            <p class="p3"><b>Protect your conversations</b></p>
            <p class="p3">The middle man services also often have copies of all instant messages sent using the service. They send push notifications by logging into your account from their servers, reading IMs and forwarding them to you.  For anything out of the most casual conversation this is unacceptable.</p>
            <p class="p3"><b>Protect your privacy</b></p>
            <p class="p3">As the developer of Monal I have decided to keep it free and not include ads and tracking software.  How many people use Monal? A lot. Thousands and thousands of people all over the world  (Hello, Antarctica!). However, all I know is what the Apple download/upgrade  counter shows and what people tell me in emails.  Much the same way I have objections to ads in my software, I do not like the “metrics” software and libraries. Unlike many other iOS apps, Monal does not contain and will never contain user tracking software.</p>
